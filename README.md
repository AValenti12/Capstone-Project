## Purpose
Airbnb has grown tremendously over the past few years offering users a convenient way to find accommodations other than traditional hotels. For this project, we decided to investigate data about past Airbnbï¿½s available in NYC and see what has made them successful. We looked at price, location, and any key amenities that may help accommodations receive higher reviews and be more sought-after properties. We have set out to help future hosts in their Airbnb journeys to learn what will increase their chances of success while hosting an Airbnb. We were interested in Airbnb since it has become such a common or go to resource and have had personal positive experiences with it. 


#
## Source of Data (Description)
We sourced our data from a data mining article from the website [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/airbnb-rental-listings-dataset-mining-f972ed08ddec
) that explored the rental landscape in New York City.

## Communication Protocols

We will meet a minimum of two times a week via Zoom to discuss progress, strategize next steps, and perform analysis. We will aso have ad-hoc Zoom meetings as needed if someone requires additional assistance or encounters an issue.  Slack is our primary communication tool where we created a group chat to provide feedback and brainstorm.

## Proposed Databases
We have setup a database in Postgres using the [schema](https://github.com/AValenti12/Capstone-Project/blob/main/ABNB%20-%20Segment%201/database/schema.sql) we created. We did not create any ERD since there's only one table to work with. We used cleaned real dataset to upload it in Postgres. We've [succesfully uploaded](https://github.com/AValenti12/Capstone-Project/blob/main/ABNB%20-%20Segment%201/images/record_count_postgress.png?raw=true) the [dataset](https://github.com/AValenti12/Capstone-Project/blob/main/ABNB%20-%20Segment%201/images/data%20uploaded_postgress.png) that we will be using throughout the project.
