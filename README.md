## Topic
Airbnb has grown tremendously over the past few years offering users a convenient way to find accommodations other than traditional hotels. For this project, we decided to investigate data about past Airbnbâ€™s available in NYC and see what has made them successful. We looked at price, location, and any key amenities that may help accommodations receive higher reviews and be more sought-after properties. We have set out to help future hosts in their Airbnb journeys to learn what will increase their chances of success while hosting an Airbnb.
