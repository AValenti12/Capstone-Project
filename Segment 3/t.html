When you leave our home or return, please lock the front door behind you.  Our home is strictly non-smoking. Please do not take any showers between 630am and 715am as we need to get in and out of the bathroom to get kids off to school.  If you are using the AC in your room, just make sure and turn it off when leaving for the day. (Unless you'll only be gone a short while. It's just too expensive to cool an empty room!) Also, please turn off lights/AC in your room if you are leaving for a significant amount of time. If you would like to use the washer and dryer, please talk to me first. Our washer uses concentrated soap and the dryer filter needs to be changed before each load. Let me show you the basics (soap, filter, etc.) It'll be quick and easy. ;) (Here's a suggestion, Not a rule ;) If you arrive into JFK or LGA, take a cab not an Uber. Ube</td>

I do not have a 'children stay free' policy. Every person in your group must be included in the guest numbers regardless of age. My policy is that guests of any age are charged the same. Therefore Airbnb's system will not calculate the correct guest numbers and accommodation fee when they're under 2's included. To manually override this, enter children under 2 as though they were in the 2-12 category. This will make sure you know exactly what you'll be charged BEFORE you book. • No pets - sorry fido has to stay home • No parties, no outside visitors or overnight guests without previous approval from your host. • Do not engage in illegal activities anywhere on the property. • If you break or damage something, please let me know and arrange for its replacement or repair. • Do not leave any food out that will attract uninvited pests.

There’s also a second entrance to building at 111 Wythe between North 8th and N 9th -  it is closest to the apartment &amp; closer to L subway. Keys:  Key marked “O” is for outside door from street, it is the same key for both entrances. “W2” key is 2nd floor door on Wythe side; “9/2” key for 2nd fl on N 9th. Key marked “a” is for apartment door, both top &amp; bottom locks. When leaving, just lock the door knob lock only and close door behind you. For shared loft guests: when home, please leave your keys visible on white chest below Mexico painting so we both know when other person’s around. Also please try to keep in mind when others are sleeping that noise does tend to travel in the loft:) Lights: can be confusing!

This up-and-coming area has a mix of folks from the Caribbean islands &amp; young professionals &amp; maintains a "real Brooklyn" vibe. It's the last area on the park to remain so culturally diverse. It's unpolished &amp; full of Jamaican restaurants, delis &amp; dollar stores, with cute bars and cafes popping up slowly. We love the diversity, the park &amp; express Q train!

Help with the regular effort of keeping a clean home like taking out trash etc. is asked and chores are shared with long term stays.  For guests staying a month or longer they are required to clean room and do laundry before departure. This allows me to give a discounted price for longer stays.  $50 key deposit returned when key is returned. For guests staying longer than one week there is an additional small cleaning fee depending on length of stay unless otherwise arranged with me.  Occasional help feeding and loving a sweet cat encouraged but not required.</td>

Less than a block from Whole Foods and the New Museum. Neat minimal design with remote control curtains and computer. No elevator.  No doorman.  Apt located on the 3rd floor. I'm always around since i live and work in the neighborhood! Everything!  It's the best neighborhood hands down. All trains within a four blocks radius.  Cabs are always around because of the location. If the listing is advertised as a private room and not an entire home it is only to comply with the new anti-Airbnb New York State Law.  For those guests who have stayed with me before nothing has changed. I.e. It is the entire apt with no share.</td>

Guests have their privacy, but may encounter me or my husband. Park Slope has been described by New York magazine as the most desirable neighborhood in the NY metropolitan area.  It consists almost entirely of buildings erected in the 1860's - 1880's.  Gaslights, churches, fine dining and shopping, and easy access to Manhattan are all parts of its appeal. There are two excellent subway stations within steps of our home, as well as many bus stops.  Manhattan is easily accessible from here, as are LaGuardia and JFK airports. Our brownstone is one of the nicest in the area.</td>
